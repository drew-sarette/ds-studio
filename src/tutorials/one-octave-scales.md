Scales help form the foundation of a violinist's technique. And no wonder, as any melody is constructed from a scale of some sort. Recall the tune of "Do Re Mi" by Rogers and Hammerstein, or "Joy to the World" by Handel. Scales are the most basic way to practice intonation, and are the ideal way to integrate your tone production, intonation, rhythm, and even posture into one coherent whole. With a commitment to daily scales, you will find yourself more confident in your ability to play all of your music with understanding, ease, and beauty!

Here are three practice ideas to help you get the most out of your scale practice:

1. **Practice slowly without counting:** This allows you to focus on playing the correct notes with good intonation and tone. By taking your time and playing each note deliberately, you can improve your finger placement and develop a better sense of pitch.

2. **Name the notes before playing them:** Speak the name of the first note (for example, "C"). Then play the note whith a stop-bow. Make sure to stop playing before naming the next note. This is a great exercise in thinking ahead, and a good way to check that you are reading the notes accurately.

3. **Slow, medium, and fast:** Set your metronome to 60bpm. Play the scale in half notes, being careful to count 2 beats for each note. When you have mastered that, move on to quarter notes, and then eighth notes. If that becomes easy, add slurs on every 2, 4, or 8 notes.

## Arpeggios

Arpeggios are often overlooked. Just as ubiquitous as scales, they afford the perfect opportunity to practice rapid string crossings, common fingering patterns, and provide a basis for understanding chords in music theory. Practice the arpeggio set that goes with each scale slowly for intonation. For added challenge, try to leave down each finger as long as possible.

## Conclusion

Make sure to give yourself enough time each day to practice the same set of scale and arpeggio patterns multiple ways. That could take as little as 3 or as much as 5 minutes depending on how long you plan to practice. Also make sure to learn each set thoroughly before moving on. Practice only one set in any given week.

With the guidance of a good teacher, your scale (& arpeggio) practice should not grow dull. Instead, each week you should have a new idea to incorporate. The as you gain fluency, your reward will be accellerated progress in the pieces you are learning, better understanding of how the music is structured, and the ability to sight-read and learn new music faster in the future.
