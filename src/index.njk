  positive life-long relationship with music through the violin. Based on the Suzuki method and twenty years of
  traditional training, Drew uses demonstrations, stories, games, and graded repertoire to get students to experience and
  internalize beautiful tone, healthy motion patterns, and fluent instrumental technique.</p>
