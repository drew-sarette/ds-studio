      <p>"Mr. Drew is an excellent teacher! I love how he makes my violin pieces funny. He always gives nice compliments every
        lesson. He is very calm and explains different ways how to work on techniques and songs that help me remember and
        understand. He shows me on his violin how my hands should look. I'm very thankful he's my teacher and love my lesson
        time!</p>
