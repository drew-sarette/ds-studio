I began playing the violin in second grade, thanks to being in an elementary school that had a violin class (one of only two in Huntsville at the time). My class teacher was a true inspiration: she demonstrated incredible artistry, kindness, and gave us many opportunities for performance. I knew I was hooked on violin when she gave me a casette tape of Vivaldi's Concerti Grossi recorded on historical instruments. I wore it out! I went on to take private lessons, participate in the Huntsville Youth Orchestra, and even perform solo in front of an audience of 3000 at the VBC (my private teacher had her students play Christmas carols at an event called Keep Christmas Alive).

In high school I studied with Jeffrey Flaniken at Samford University, and eventually decided that I wanted music to be my life. Tw
