description: My education, experience, and recent engagements.
---

I received a Bachelor of Music from Samford University, where I studied violin with Jeffrey Flaniken. While at Samford, I was a member of the University Orchestra, performed in many operas and musicals, and had the opportunitiy to perform throughout the Dominican Republic with the orchestra. I performed in masterclasses given by the St. Lawrence String Quartet, The Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, and Phillipe Quint. I also studied violin pedagogy with Caroline Nordlund, and began teaching lessons. Some of my students were admitted to the Alabama School of the Fine Arts.  

While completing my Master's degree at the University of Louisville, I had the opportunity to study with David Updegraf, Hal Grosman, Pattrick Rafferty, and Brittany MacWilliams. As a graduate teaching assistant, I taught violin to music education majors in String Methods classes. I also taught undergraduate violin lessons and coached chamber groups. I was principal 2nd violin in the university orchestra, and served as concertmaster for Bizet's opera *Doctor Miracle*.

Since graduating, I have continued my education through Suzuki teacher training with Dr. Timothy Durbin, and have now completed all ten units. I have participated in several music festivals, including the Sewanee Summer Music Festival, where I served as concertmaster on two occasions. I have always had a deep interest in historical performance, and have studied Baroque violin with Alice Culin Ellison, and participated in Oberlin's Baroque Performance Institute as well as Tafelmusik Baroque Summer Institute. I perform on both Baroque and modern instruments. 

My recent performance engagements have included the University of Louisville's New Music Festival, the Lenten Recital Series at Calvary Episcopal Church (Louisville, KY), and several chamber music concerts in collaboration with Louisville musicians. My orchestral experience includes Lexington Chamber Orchestra, where I was assistant concertmaster, section second violin in Orchestra Kentucky Bowling Green, as well as substitute work with Huntsville Symphony Orchestra, Paducah Symphony Orchestra, Owensboro Symphony Orchestra, and others.
