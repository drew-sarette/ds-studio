Drew Sarette is a teacher and freelance violinist. He holds bachelor’s and masters degrees from Samford University and the University of Louisville, and has studied Suzuki violin pedagogy (units 1-10) with teacher-trainer Terry Durbin. He has taught students ranging from age four to the university level, and his students have participated in Floyd County Youth Symphony, Kentuckiana Philharmonic, Louisville Youth Orchestra, and Indiana All-State. Students have deepened their appreciation for music, advanced to leadership positions in their ensembles, performed in regular studio recitals, and been accepted into music education programs at the University of Louisville and the University of Northern Kentucky.

Drew believes the teacher’s role is to guide and accompany the student on a journey of discovery, developing a positive life-long relationship with music through the violin. Based on the Suzuki method and twenty years of traditional training, Drew uses demonstrations, stories, games, and graded repertoire to get students to experience and internalize beautiful tone, healthy motion patterns, and fluent instrumental technique.

When not teaching, Drew has served as assistant concertmaster for the Lexington Chamber Orchestra, and performs with Huntsville Symphony Orchestra, Orchestra Sul Ponticello, Shoals Symphony Orchestra, and others on an auxiliary basis. Drew is passionate about Historical Performance, and performs on both Baroque and modern instruments.
