## Payment

* The flat monthly rate is the same for months with five or four lessons.
* Some months, I may plan to be absent for performances or travel. In those cases, I will deduct those lessons from your monthly bill.
* Payment for the month is due by the first lesson of that month.
* I cannot give refunds after payment is received.

## Rescheduling

* Remember, paying the monthly lesson fee reserves you a specific slot in my weekly teaching schedule;  rescheduling is purely at my discretion.
* In case of illness/emergency, I will offer you either a virtual lesson if you are able to play, or a video exchange if you need time to recover.
* If I cancel due to illness or emergency, I will make up the lesson at our earliest opportunity or credit you for the next month. 

## Planned Absences

* I expect to meet every student every week that school is in session.
* During the summer months, I may deduct lessons for planned travel at my discretion.
* Should a student attend a summer music festival or camp, I will deduct those weeks from the bill, provided I am notified the month before.

## Trial Lessons

* A 30 minute trial lesson is $30.

## Referrals

* A lesson credit will be awarded for a referral to a new student, if I am accepting new students.

## Parent Guidelines

* Parent attendance is required for all young students’ or beginners’ lessons.
* The parent who attends lessons must be able to participate in daily practice.
* The lesson parent must take notes. This ensures that you and the student know how to practice at home.
* Any minor students must be accompanied by an adult.  The accompanying adult may sit in during the lesson, or wait in the waiting area. 

## Instrument Guidelines

* Instrument rental: Rental is the easiest solution for a growing student who will need several instruments of different sizes before getting a permanent instrument. Contact me for a referral to a reputable shop.
* Instrument purchase: Please do not buy an instrument for your student without bringing it to me to check the fit and quality of the instrument. Please do not buy from online sellers without checking with me! I am always happy to assist in the instrument search.  

## Practice Requirements

* All students must practice every day.  
* Beginners should start with 10 min of daily practice, and add time as needed.
* A general rule of thumb: You should be practicing every day at least as long as your lesson is.

## Ending Lessons

* You agree to notify me by text or email on or before the 15th if you intend to discontinue lessons the next month. 
* If you notify me after the 15th, you agree to pay the full amount for the next month. You would, of course, be welcome and encouraged to attend that last month of lessons either in person or virtually.
