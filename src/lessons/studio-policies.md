## Payment and Cancellation Policy

* My base rate is currently $60 per hour. Lessons are generally 30, 45, or 60 minutes. 15 minute lessons are available for very young students.
* Payment for the month is due by the first lesson of that month. An invoice will be sent before that.
* I am unable to refund any lesson fees after payment. I will make my best attempt to reschedule a lesson if you notify me in advance (at least 1 day) if something comes up.
* In case of illness or emergency the day of your lesson, I will be happy to reschedule your lesson time for later, or credit you for the next month if that is not possible.
* Lateness may result in a loss of lesson time. If I am late, I will either make up the time I missed or give a credit for the next month.

## Scholarship

* A limited number of scholarships are available for students with financial need. Please use the [contact form](/contact/) for details!

## Free Trial Lessons and Referrals

* 30-minute trial lessons are free! I want you to be sure that we are a good fit before you sign up.
* A lesson credit will be awarded for a referral to a new student, if I am accepting new students.

## Parent and Student Guidelines

* Parent attendance is required for all young students’ or beginners’ lessons. We will make a plan at the beginning of lessons.
* All assigned music and books must be brought to every lesson. This includes a practice chart from the last lesson and all assigned technique handouts. It is recommended to put all handouts in a small 3-ring binder to keep it organized.

## Instrument Guidelines

* Instrument rental: Rental is probably the easiest solution for a growing student who will need several different violins of different sizes before getting a permanent instrument. Contact me for a referral to a reputable shop.
* Instrument purchase: Please do not buy an instrument for your student without bringing it to me to check the fit and quality of the instrument. Please do not buy violins on Amazon or Ebay, because it is necessary to try out an instrument before buying it. Beware the dreaded VSO (Violin Shaped Object): these brightly painted toys, usually sold online, are impossible to tune and lack the construction required for good tone production.

## Recitals, Competitions, and Festivals

* Recitals are important to the development and motivation of students, so all are expected to attend and perform in all studio recitals (about 2 each year) if possible.
* Competitions are a valuable experience for advancing students. I do not coach students for specific competitions, but all students are encouraged to seek out these opportunities and coordinate with me about the repertoire requirements. I will occasionally ask students to participate in competitions and masterclasses.
* Summer festivals and lessons: I will guide students through the application process for summer festivals, which are excellent opportunities for students. I expect to meet regularly with students who are not attending a festival.

## Practice Requirements

* All students should practice every day.
* Parents should encourage practice by:

  * being aware of what the student is learning
  * giving positive reinforcement
  * guiding the student based on the goals the teacher has set during the lesson
* Beginners should start with 10 min of daily practice and build up to 1 hour.
* Advanced students should practice between 2 and 3 hours daily.

## Ending Lessons

* If you decide to discontinue lessons, please let me know as soon as you are able. A month's notice is greatly apreciated.
* I may decide to discontinue lessons if a problem persists after I have brought it to your attention, such as lateness, absences, or missed payment.
