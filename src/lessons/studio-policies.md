## Payment and Cancellation Policy
- Payment for the month is due by the first lesson of that month. An invoice will be sent before that.
- Cancellations may be made by phone or email at least one day in advance, or the day of in case of illness. I will make my best attempt to reschedule your lesson if you give me time!
- A lesson credit will be applied to the next month if there is an illness/emergency and we cannot reschedule the same week.
- Except in case of illness or emergency, I cannot refund or reschedule for same-day cancellations and no-shows. 
- Lateness may result in a loss of lesson time. If I am late, I will either make up the time I missed or give you a credit for the next month.

## Parent and Student Guidelines
- Parent attendance is required for all young students’ or beginners’ lessons (generally under the age of 13). I will not teach if the student is not accompanied by a parent.
- Beginners commit to one year of lessons. As a new student, a commitment to yourself that you will work toward a long-term goal gives you both a source of motivation and a sense of achievement.
- All assigned music and books must be brought to every lesson. This includes a practice chart from your last lesson and all assigned technique handouts. It is recommended to put all handouts in a small 3-ring binder to keep it organized.

## Instrument Guidelines
- Instrument rental: Rental is probably the easiest solution for a growing student who will need several different violins of different sizes before getting a permanent instrument. Contact me for a referral to a reputable shop.
- Instrument purchase: Please do not buy an instrument for your student without bringing it to me to check the fit and quality of the instrument. Please do not buy violins on Amazon or Ebay, because it is essential to try out an instrument before buying it. Beware the dreaded VSO (Violin Shaped Object): these brightly painted toys, usually sold online, are impossible to tune and lack the construction required for good tone production.

## Free Trial Lessons and Referrals
- 30-minute trial lessons are free! I want you to be sure that we are a good fit before you sign up.
- A lesson credit will be awarded for a referral to a new student, if I am accepting new students.

## Recitals, Competitions, and Festivals
- Recitals are all-important to the development and motivation of students, so all are expected to attend and perform in all studio recitals (about 2 each year) if possible.
- Competitions are a valuable experience for advancing students. I do not coach students for specific competitions, but all students are encouraged to seek out these opportunities and coordinate with me about the repertoire requirements. I will occasionally ask students to participate in competitions and masterclasses.
- Summer festivals and lessons: I will guide students through the application process for summer festivals, which are very important for young musicians to attend. I expect to meet regularly with students who are not attending a festival.

## Practice Requirements
- All students should practice every day.
- Without daily practice, the student will not progress, and will eventually lose interest and quit.
- Parents should encourage practice by:
    - Being aware of what the student is learning
    - Giving positive reinforcement
    - Guiding the student based on the goals the teacher has set during the lesson
- Beginners should start with 10 min of daily practice and build up to 1 hour.
- Advanced students should practice between 2 and 3 hours daily.
- If your student is participating in too many other activities, it is recommended to drop some other activities to free up some time for practice.

## Ending Lessons
- If you decide to discontinue lessons, please let me know as soon as you are able. A month's notice is greatly apreciated.
- I may decide to discontinue lessons if a problem persists after I have brought it to your attention, such as lateness, absences, missed payment.
