## Payment, Scheduling, and Cancellations

* My rate is $60 per hour. Lessons are generally 30, 45, or 60 minutes. 15 minute lessons are available for very young students.
* Payment for the month is due by the first lesson of that month. 
* Before the beginning of each month, we can discuss any scheduling issues. When we are in agreement, I will send an email with the schedule and bill.   
* I cannot give refunds after payment is received.  
* I will **attempt** to reschedule in case of illness or an emergency.

## Free Trial Lessons and Referrals

* 30-minute trial lessons are free! I want you to be sure that we are a good fit before you sign up.
* A lesson credit will be awarded for a referral to a new student, if I am accepting new students.

## Parent Guidelines

* Parent attendance is required for all young students’ or beginners’ lessons. We will make a plan at the beginning of lessons.
* The parent who attends lessons must be able to participate in daily practice.
* The lesson parent must take notes. This ensures that you and the student know how to practice at home.
* As a student develops executive function, parent attendance is not needed in each lesson.

## Instrument Guidelines

* Instrument rental: Rental is probably the easiest solution for a growing student who will need several different violins of different sizes before getting a permanent instrument. Contact me for a referral to a reputable shop.
* Instrument purchase: Please do not buy an instrument for your student without bringing it to me to check the fit and quality of the instrument. Please do not buy violins on Amazon or Ebay, because it is necessary to try out an instrument before buying it. Beware the dreaded VSO (Violin Shaped Object): these brightly painted toys, usually sold online, are impossible to tune and lack the construction required for good tone production.

## Recitals

* Recitals are important to the development and motivation of students, so all are expected to attend and perform in all studio recitals (about 2 each year) if possible.

## Practice Requirements
* All students should practice every day.
* Beginners should start with 10 min of daily practice, and add time as needed.
* A general rule of thumb: You should be practicing every day at least as long as your lesson is.

## Ending Lessons

* If you decide to discontinue lessons, please let me know as soon as you are able. A month's notice is greatly appreciated.
* I may decide to discontinue lessons if a problem persists after I have brought it to your attention, such as lateness, absences, or missed payment.
