## Payment

* My rate is $65 per hour for weekly lessons. Lessons are generally 30, 45, or 60 minutes. 15 minute lessons are available for very young students.
* Payment for the month is due by the first lesson of that month.  Before that, you will receive an email listing the scheduled lessons, and the total for the month.  
* I cannot give refunds after payment is received.

## Absence and Make-up Lessons

* If you need to reschedule, please notify me at least one week in advance. I will ***attempt*** to reschedule your lesson.
* Rescheduled lessons may need to be held by video call, depending on my location/schedule.
* In case of illness/emergency, I am happy to reschedule your lesson.

## Planned Absences

* I expect to meet every student every week during the school calendar.
* I expect to meet most weeks during the summer break. If you are planning a trip during the summer, I will remove those lessons from your bill if you let me know the month before. 

## Trial Lessons

* A 30 minute trial lesson is $30.

## Referrals

* A lesson credit will be awarded for a referral to a new student, if I am accepting new students.

## Parent Guidelines

* Parent attendance is required for all young students’ or beginners’ lessons. We will make a plan at the beginning of lessons.
* The parent who attends lessons must be able to participate in daily practice.
* The lesson parent must take notes. This ensures that you and the student know how to practice at home.
* As a student develops executive function, parent attendance is not needed in each lesson.

## Instrument Guidelines

* Instrument rental: Rental is probably the easiest solution for a growing student who will need several different violins of different sizes before getting a permanent instrument. Contact me for a referral to a reputable shop.
* Instrument purchase: Please do not buy an instrument for your student without bringing it to me to check the fit and quality of the instrument. Please do not buy violins on Amazon or Ebay, because it is necessary to try out an instrument before buying it. Beware the dreaded VSO (Violin Shaped Object): these brightly painted toys, usually sold online, are impossible to tune and lack the construction required for good tone production.

## Practice Requirements

* All students must practice every day.  
* Beginners should start with 10 min of daily practice, and add time as needed.
* A general rule of thumb: You should be practicing every day at least as long as your lesson is.

## Ending Lessons

* Please notify me in writing (text or email) before the 15th of the month before you decide to discontinue lessons. If you notify me after the 15th, you agree to pay for a total of four lessons in the following month, which you may attend as usual.
