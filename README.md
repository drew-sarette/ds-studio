# Violin Teacher's Studio Website

This project is a website for a violin teacher's studio. It was developed using Eleventy and deployed on Netlify. The main goals were to create a simple page that would use existing services such as calendly, paypal, Netlify, etc... to provide a low cost, low maintenance, and flexible website for a music teacher. 

## Features

    - uses html checkbox with pure css to animate a menu button, using SVGs
2. Designed with accessibility in mind
    - uses semantic html, aria attributes, a user-friendly skip link that remains visible for 1 second regardless of how fast a user tabs.
    - Passes WAVE audit
3. SVGs used for the logo, buttons, etc... were customized and simplified using Inkscape.
4. Connected to DecapCMS for easy management and hosted on Netlify
